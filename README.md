## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

For this project I wanted to create something creepy in the beggining. The key point of this project is that we are asked to draw a face on the face in image and that reminds me photos usually seen in horror movie that faces on it are covered and filled with paint. However, when I added face parts on the paint it start looking like a cute character so I changed the plan and decided to go charactaristic/cartoonish face by useing curvy shapes. The attribues used is the zigzag/spiral background, 3 different colored background, half closed/full opend eyes, open/closed mouth.
